<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Jason Nunez is a registered nurse, content creator, and entrepreneur who built a platform to help nurses take control of their finances and careers. Alongside his wife Monica, he co-founded the Nurses to Riches Accelerator, a mentorship program that helps nurses relocate to Northern California, land high-paying hospital jobs, and achieve financial independence. Their own journey—paying off over $128,000 in debt in under a year and building a six-figure income working under 20 hours a week—serves as the foundation for the program.</p>

<p>He’s also the founder of Map My Pay, a mobile app that allows nurses to compare salaries, housing costs, and take-home pay across more than 590 U.S. cities. The app factors in taxes, mortgage/rent, crime rates, investment potential, and even lets nurses upload paystubs to get real community insights. Jason has led multiple development teams, transitioned his backend from web scraping to APIs, and is preparing for a national rollout. His content regularly reaches tens of thousands of nurses across YouTube, Instagram, and newsletters.</p>

<p>Through his work, Jason challenges outdated financial advice, shines a light on wage inequality, and empowers nurses with transparent data and actionable tools. His tone is blunt, real, and always grounded in lived experience—whether he’s breaking down tax bills, exposing hospital pay gaps, or helping others avoid the $70,000 financial mistakes he and Monica once made.</p>
